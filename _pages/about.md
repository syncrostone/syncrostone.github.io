I am an [MPhil in Engineering](https://www.postgraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/directory/egegmpmeg) student working with [Dr. Guillaume Hennequin](https://ghennequin.github.io/people/hennequin/) for the 2020-21 year, and a member of Churchill College. I am supported by a [Churchill Scholarship](https://www.churchillscholarship.org/). I am broadly interested in motor-control, learning, and memory and am currently working on developing methods for analyzing neural data using Gaussian Process methods. In Fall 2021 I am excited to begin working toward a PhD in Neurobiology & Behavior at Columbia University, supported by an NSF GRFP fellowship.

I recently graduated from Yale with a B.S. in Computer Science where I developed and released [PsychRNN](https://psychrnn.readthedocs.io/), a software package for modeling decision-making, memory, and other cognitive tasks using recurrent neural networks under the supervision of [Dr. John Murray](https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/murray/pi/). I previously researched human depth processing with Drs. [Alex Huk](http://motion.cps.utexas.edu/people/alex-huk/) and [Larry Cormack](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/psychology/faculty/lkc3) at UT Austin, and  I researched algorithms for calcium ion imaging with [Dr. Jeremy Freeman](https://www.janelia.org/freeman-lab) at Janelia. I also interned at Google and at [CTRL-Labs](https://www.ctrl-labs.com/), a brain machine interface company recently acquired by Facebook.
